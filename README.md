# Datepicker-UI
In this project, I created a simple datepicker UI using only HTML and CSS. It will not be a functional datepicker, but a static UI component that you can later enhance with JavaScript.
The goal of this project is to help me practice positioning, layout, and styling techniques in CSS. More details of the project can be found here https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui
